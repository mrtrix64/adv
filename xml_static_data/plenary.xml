In 1992, he was selected by the Canadian Space Agency as a NASA Mission Specialist—Canada’s first fully-qualified Space Shuttle crew member. Three years later, aboard Shuttle Atlantis, he was the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in space, and the first Canadian to board a Russian spacecraft as he helped build space station “Mir.” In 2001, aboard Shuttle Endeavour, Colonel Hadfield performed two spacewalks—the first Canadian to do so— and, in 2013, he was Commander of the International Space Station—the first and only Canadian to ever command a spaceship—so far.



During his multi-faceted career Hadfield has intercepted Soviet bombers in Canadian airspace, lived on the ocean floor, been NASA’s Director of Operations in Russia, and recorded science and music videos seen by hundreds of millions.]]></speaker1_desc><speaker1_img><![CDATA[Chris_Hadfield_cropped_140x140.jpg]]></speaker1_img><speaker2_name><![CDATA[]]></speaker2_name><speaker2_desc><![CDATA[]]></speaker2_desc><speaker2_img><![CDATA[]]></speaker2_img><speaker3_name><![CDATA[]]></speaker3_name><speaker3_desc><![CDATA[]]></speaker3_desc><speaker3_img><![CDATA[]]></speaker3_img><date_time><![CDATA[5]]></date_time><time><![CDATA[12:10 - 13:10]]></time><schedule_title_id><![CDATA[5]]></schedule_title_id><schedule_date><![CDATA[2016-04-19]]></schedule_date><schedule_title><![CDATA[Day 4]]></schedule_title><friendly_date><![CDATA[Tuesday 19th April]]></friendly_date><publish><![CDATA[y]]></publish></record><record><cms_id><![CDATA[266]]></cms_id><cms_heading><![CDATA[Conference Reflections]]></cms_heading><cms_content><![CDATA[<p></p>]]></cms_content><cms_image1><![CDATA[]]></cms_image1><cms_image1_alt><![CDATA[]]></cms_image1_alt><cms_image2><![CDATA[]]></cms_image2><cms_image2_alt><![CDATA[]]></cms_image2_alt><cms_cat><![CDATA[8]]></cms_cat><publish><![CDATA[y]]></publish><sort_order><![CDATA[6]]></sort_order><advertising><![CDATA[]]></advertising><speaker1_name><![CDATA[Steven Esom]]></speaker1_name><speaker1_desc><![CDATA[Steven Esom is currently Non-Executive Chairman at Advantage Travel Partnership.
